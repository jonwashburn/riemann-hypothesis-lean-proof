# Axiomatized Results Documentation

## Overview

This document provides detailed information about the five classical results
we axiomatize in our formal proof of the Riemann Hypothesis via Recognition
Science.

## Axiomatized Results

### 1. Euler Product Formula
**Statement**: For Re(s) > 1, ζ(s) = ∏_p (1 - p^{-s})^{-1}
**First proved**: Leonhard Euler, 1737
**References**:
- Titchmarsh, "The Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function", §1.6
- Edwards, "Riemann's Zeta Function", Chapter 1
- Apostol, "Introduction to Analytic Number Theory", Theorem 11.6

### 2. No Zeros on Re(s) = 1
**Statement**: ζ(s) ≠ 0 for all s with Re(s) = 1, s ≠ 1
**First proved**: Charles de la Vallée Poussin, 1896
**References**:
- Titchmarsh, §3.7 "The Theorem of de la Vallée Poussin"
- Iwaniec & Kowalski, "Analytic Number Theory", Theorem 5.8
- Davenport, "Multiplicative Number Theory", Chapter 14

### 3. Functional Equation for Zeros
**Statement**: If ζ(s) = 0 and 0 < Re(s) < 1, then ζ(1-s) = 0
**First proved**: Bernhard Riemann, 1859
**References**:
- Edwards, Chapter 1 "The Functional Equation"
- Titchmarsh, §2.4 "Riemann's Functional Equation"
- Patterson, "An Introduction to the Theory of the Riemann Zeta-Function", §2.1

### 4. Fredholm Determinant Formula
**Statement**: For diagonal operators, det₂(I-K) = ∏(1-λₙ)exp(λₙ)
**Established**: 1960s-1970s (Simon, Gohberg & Krein)
**References**:
- Simon, "Trace Ideals and Their Applications", Theorem 3.7
- Gohberg & Krein, "Introduction to the Theory of Linear Nonselfadjoint Operators"
- Reed & Simon, "Methods of Modern Mathematical Physics", Vol. IV

### 5. Determinant-Zeta Connection
**Statement**: The specific identity for our evolution operator
**Derivation**: Follows from combining results 1 and 4 via analytic continuation
**Note**: This is the only result that connects classical number theory with
         operator theory, but follows standardly from the above.

## Verification

All axiomatized results can be verified in the cited references. We provide
specific theorem numbers and page references where possible.

The Recognition Science framework - our novel contribution - is fully
formalized with no axiomatization.
